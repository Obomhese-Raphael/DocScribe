A seed, small and brown, felt the sun and the rain. It yearned to burst forth, to see the world above. Days turned into weeks, weeks into months. Other sprouts shot up quickly, flaunting their green leaves. The little seed felt forgotten. But deep within, it held onto the quiet promise of growth. Finally, a tiny crack appeared. Slowly, a shoot unfurled, reaching for the light. It wasn't the first, nor the tallest, but its roots ran deep, its stem strong. It knew then, the long wait had made its blossoming all the more beautiful.
