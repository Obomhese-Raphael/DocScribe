**Power of the Blacks**

In the heart of the night, where the stars gleam bright,  
A legacy whispers, igniting the fight.  
From the depths of the past, where shadows once lay,  
Emerges a spirit that won’t fade away.  

With rhythms of drums, and voices that soar,  
A tapestry woven from struggle and lore.  
From the fields of despair to the heights of the dream,  
Resilience flows like an unyielding stream.  

In the face of the storm, they rise and they stand,  
With courage unbroken, united, hand in hand.  
From the chains of oppression, they’ve forged a new way,  
A testament written in the light of the day.  

With wisdom of ages, they carry the flame,  
In the halls of the mighty, they’ve carved out their name.  
From the poets and thinkers to warriors bold,  
Their stories of triumph are timelessly told.  

In the canvas of culture, their colors ignite,  
A symphony vibrant, a powerful sight.  
With each brushstroke of history, they paint the divine,  
A legacy rich, like the finest of wine.  

Through the trials and tears, they’ve learned to embrace,  
The strength of their roots, the pride in their grace.  
For the power of Blacks is a force to behold,  
A narrative woven in courage and gold.  

So let the world witness, let the truth be unfurled,  
The power of Blacks, a light in the world.  
With hearts full of hope and dreams that won’t cease,  
They rise like the sun, bringing justice and peace.
